* Group project with [Nico404](https://github.com/Nico404) and [lxmuresan](https://github.com/lxmuresan)
* Created a tool capable of indicating which classic author's style a text resembles.
* Used the Gutenberg API to collect raw texts from 40 different authors.
* Tested and gridsearched the following models : CNN Conv1D, RNN GRU, RNN LSTM, BERT and distilBERT.
* Opted for Hugging Face's distilBert which had a val accuracy of 0.7.

* Created an app that can predict the survival of a passenger of the Titanic.
* Used and preprocessed Kaggle's Titanic dataset.
* Tested a Random Forest Classifier, an Adaboost, a KNN and an ensemble method using all three models.
* Chose the Random Forest Classifier, gridsearched parameters and obtained an accuracy of 0.88.

[Check](https://titanic-mistake.streamlit.app/) whether you would have survived. 


## Data Analysis projects : 

### [Olist : analysing a Brazilian e-commerce platform](https://olist.com/pt-br/)

* Created a dashboard based on Olist's open-source data on its customers and their orders.
* Collected data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce)
* Used **Python** and **Pandas** to feature-engineer and clean data prior to analysis.
* Used **Tableau** to create worksheets and dashboard.
